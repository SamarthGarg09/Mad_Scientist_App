# Mad_Scientist_App
This app is entirely based on the kotlin language.
This is a quiz app consisting of specific questions related to physics.
The app will open up with an icon of an image of a mad scientist.
The app will ask the user five questions, and users have to give all the answers correctly.
The users can also share their results via WhatsApp, messaging, EMAIL, on answering all questions correctly.
If they lose by giving any answer incorrectly, they can either restart the quiz or quit the game.
The app has some funny images of scientists who show their expressions on different game stages, making the app funnier.
Talking about the structure of the app, it is using five fragments.
It has a navigation drawer, in which, at the top, it has an image as nav-header and below it, has two navigation menu.
Navigation concepts are brilliantly used in this app; either you talk about navHostFragment,navView, nav controller, navigation graphs,navigationMenu and many more.
An overflow menu has been provided on the top-right of the action bar, which directs the user to the intro fragment.
At the top-left, an up button is given in all the fragment, which pops out the current fragment from the fragment back stack and directs the user to the previous fragment.
The transition from one fragment to another is done through beautiful animations like bounce, rotate,zoom in and many more.
Various beautiful fonts like amaranth, aref_ruqaa, etc., have been used, which makes the app more attractive.
Users can also share their result using implicit intents with any other applications.
The result would be shared in the form of a string.
Users can restart the game from both congratulations and lost fragment, which makes it more versatile.
This app has been solely created by an individual and not by a group. This app may have many drawbacks, but I would like it if anyone wants to improve it.
